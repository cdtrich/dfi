    title: "Connectivity and infrastructure",
    paragraphs: [
      "Universal, affordable, and meaningful connectivity is the foundation of an inclusive digital future. Without access to reliable infrastructure, the promise of the Internet as a driver of development, empowerment, and opportunity remains out of reach for millions.",
      "Connectivity is not just about access—it’s about quality, resilience, and equity. Measuring progress in this area involves assessing the availability and affordability of digital technologies, the robustness of national infrastructure, and the extent to which networks remain open and uninterrupted.",
      "By tracking how countries expand digital infrastructure and maintain open, secure, and resilient networks, this cardinal point provides insights into their commitment to leaving no one behind.",
      "Connectivity and infrastructure are not ends in themselves. They are the enablers of all other digital rights and opportunities. A future-proof, people-centered digital environment begins here.",

    title: "Rights and freedoms",
    paragraphs: [
      "A healthy digital environment depends on the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. This cardinal point captures a core principle of the Global Digital Compact: that human rights must be protected online as they are offline.",
      "This dimension reflects both legal guarantees and real-world practices. It examines how well national laws protect civil and political liberties, whether people can safely exercise their rights online without censorship or surveillance, and whether institutions like courts and regulators uphold the rule of law in digital contexts.",
      "In practice, this cardinal point reveals how governments balance authority and accountability, and whether digital governance strengthens or erodes trust in institutions.",
      "The Rights and Freedoms cardinal point is essential for evaluating whether technology is being used to empower individuals—or to limit their voice, access, and agency in the digital age.",

    title: "Responsibility and sustainability",
    paragraphs: [
      "As digital transformation accelerates, so does the need for responsible governance and long-term sustainability. This cardinal point reflects a key commitment of the Global Digital Compact: to develop digital policies that are not only inclusive and ethical, but also environmentally sustainable and economically equitable.",
      "Responsibility in the digital age means designing and deploying technologies—such as artificial intelligence—in ways that are transparent, fair, and accountable.",
      "At the same time, sustainability demands urgent attention to the environmental costs of digitalisation. The growth of digital infrastructure, devices, and consumption has contributed to rising electronic waste and energy use.",
      "This cardinal point assesses how countries embed responsibility into their digital policies—whether through ethical standards for AI, inclusive trade frameworks, or efforts to reduce the environmental footprint of their digital economies.",
      "A truly inclusive and future-oriented Internet must be not only innovative, but also fair, accountable, and sustainable by design.",

    title: "Trust and resilience",
    paragraphs: [
      "Trust is the cornerstone of a safe and inclusive digital future. Without it, individuals hesitate to engage online, institutions lose credibility, and societies become more vulnerable to disinformation, cyber threats, and systemic instability.",
      "Trust must be earned—through transparent governance, effective cybersecurity, and institutional accountability.",
      "Resilience speaks to the ability of systems—not just technologies, but also institutions and communities—to withstand shocks and recover effectively.",
      "This cardinal point also considers the quality of governance and oversight—whether institutions act with integrity, respond to challenges transparently, and involve stakeholders in decision-making.",
      "Together, trust and resilience are the foundation for a digital future that is secure, stable, and worthy of public confidence.",
